# Automated-Program-Repair
This repo contains all the code, artifacts, and submitted documents for the project.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use random search algorithm to fix runtime exceptions in Expertiza automatically

### Research Questions
 - **RQ1:** What percentage of runtime exception errors in Expertiza can be fixed by random search algorithm?
 - **RQ2:** On average, how long will it take random search algorithm to fix one Expertiza bug?
 
### Evaluation Plan
 - **RQ1**
  - Metric: number of  runtime exception errors fixed by automated evolutionary program repair out of the total number of selected errors.
  - Artifact: unresolved Expertiza runtime exception errors caught by Airbrake.
  
 - **RQ2**
  - Metric: average time consumed by random search algorithm to fix one bug.
  - Artifact: unresolved Expertiza  runtime exception errors caught by Airbrake.
  
### Timeline
 - Unresolved bug selection (Oct. 7 to Oct. 13)
 - Random search algorithm implementation (Oct. 14 to Oct. 31)
 - Automated bug fixing (Nov. 1 to Nov. 17)
 - Result analysis (Nov. 18 to Nov. 23)
 - Final paper writing (Nov. 24 to Nov. 31)
